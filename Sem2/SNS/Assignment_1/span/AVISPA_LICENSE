2. PREAMBLE
===========
The AVISPA Tool is a modular tool that incorporates and makes use also
of a number of software packages not developed by the AVISPA Team.

In particular:

* the SATMC back-end may invoke one of the following SAT-solvers:

  - mchaff
  - SIM
  - SATO v3.0

  For the convenience of the user these solvers are distributed with
  the AVISPA package, but since they may rely on different licensing
  policies, users of the AVISPA Tool are invited to carefully read the
  licenses (if any) associated with these solvers.  

* the TA4SP back-end uses a tree automata library Timbuk developed by
  Thomas Genet (IRISA, Rennes-France).  This program is distributed
  under the GNU LGP.  For more details see the files COPYING and LGPL
  in the TA4SP directory of the AVISPA package distribution. 

The rest of this LICENSE applies only to the software modules
developed by the AVISPA Team.
