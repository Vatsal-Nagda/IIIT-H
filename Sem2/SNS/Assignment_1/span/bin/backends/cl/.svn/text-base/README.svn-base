===========================================================


Overview:
---------

CL-Atse is an OCaml-based implementation of the deduction 
rules developed in the CASRUL tool-suite and the AVISPA 
European project. These rules allows anyone to interpret 
and automatically "execute" a protocol in every possible 
ways against an generic intruder with the Dolev-Yao 
deductional capabilities. A protocol, written in the 
Avispa's intermediate format is executed over a finite 
(user decided) number of iterations, or entirely if no loop 
is involved. There are no other restrictions: either an 
attack is found, or the protocol is claimed to be secured 
over the given number of sessions. The search for attacks 
can be parametrised. In particular, the protocol's objects 
can be typed or untyped, and the pair can be free or 
(partially) associative. The Xor operator and it's ACUN 
properties is under developpement. Finally, CL-Atse performs 
two kind of optimizations : First, the protocol specification
itself is simplified to accelerate the search for attacks 
(steps merged or removed, useless messages ignored, etc..). 
Second, various optimizations in the deduction rules try to 
reduce, and often eliminate, redundancies and uselessness in 
the protocol execution.

CL-Atse is developed in the context of the EU Project AVISPA (Automated
Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications,
www.avispa-project.org IST-2001-39252). Earlier development on OFMC
took place in the context of the predecessor project AVISS (Automated
Verification of Infinite-State Systems IST-2000-26410).

All analysis tools of the AVISPA project are based on two
specification languages: HLPSL (the High-Level Protocol Specification
Language) and IF (the Intermediate Format). The HLPSL allows for an
easy description of protocols by the user, while the IF is a low-level
language suited for automatic input to analysis tools.  The HLPSL2IF
translator, also shipped as part of the AVISPA Tool, is developed at
INRIA Nancy.


Install:
--------

You do not need anything to run cl-atse alone. However, to run it
with the other avispa's tools, make sure that :

- the $AVISPA_PACKAGE variable contain the path to the avispa-package
  directory. For example, if it is in /home/mathieu/avispa-pack
  then with Debian uses $export AVISPA_PACKAGE=/home/mathieu/avispa-pack

- the cl-atse binary file must be present in the avispa-package
  hierarchy, at the following positions :
  $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/cl/cl-atse  for the binary file
  $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/cl.bash     for the script file


Usage:
------

In general, CL-Atse is called directly by the AVISPA Tool.  You can
specify CL-Atse as the desired back-end using the --cl switch as
follows:
   avispa <filename> [OPTIONS] --cl-atse [CL-ATSE OPTIONS]

Should you wish to call CL-Atse directly, you can do so as follows:
( cl-atse is usually in $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/cl/cl-atse )

   cl-atse <inputfiles> [CL-ATSE OPTIONS]

<inputfiles> can be any set of if or hlpsl files. However, if any
            hlpsl file is provided, then the hlpsl2if translator
            must be accessible by cl-atse. This is either
            present in ./; path known by $HLPSL2IF; or accessible
            with the $AVISPA_PACKAGE variable (default). Be also
            aware that when given a set of input files, CL-Atse
            will output it's analysis of each sequentially. 
            To give a set of files as input is particularly useful
            when using the -bench option.

CL-ATSE OPTION can be any set of cl-atse options including :

  -nb n   : Maximum number of role iterations (or loops, default is 3)
            This option bound the maximum number of times
            cl-atse is allowed to re-execute any loop
            in the protocol specification. Since a role iteration
            (same role re-executed in sequence) is a loop, this
            also bound the maximum number of times each role
            instance is executed sequentially. However, this
            do not bound the parallel role executions, which
            are already bounded in the if file.

  -light  : Force the use of non-associative unification algorithm.
            By default, this option is only activated if non restrictive.

  -notype : Do not take the typing constraints into account.
            That is, a variable of type pair can be instantiated with
	    a cipher bloc or a nonce with this option.

  -td     : Perform depth-first search (default, less memory)
            This control the search for attacks in cl-atse.
            This is the fastest search and the less memory dependant,
            but it can provide non-minimal attacks.

  -lr     : Perform breath-first search (minimal attack)
            With this option, cl-atse always output one of the
            shortest attacks (if any). However, memory use can
            be much higher.

  -out    : Write the attack to file.atk (if any). Simple stdout forward.

  -dir d  : Output directory to use with -out. Also, any temporary
            if file generated by hlpsl2if is placed in this directory.
            (CL-Atse call hlpsl2if when provided a hlpsl file)

  -ns     : Do not simplify the IF file (complete trace)
            With the option, Cl-Atse is forbidden to simplify the given 
            protocol specification (if file). The protocol simplification
            is an important step which allow CL-Atse to search for attacks
            much more rapidly. However, you might want to use this 
            option with the -noexec option to see the protocol specification
            as interpreted from CL-Atse directly from the .if file.
            Since CL-Atse's output is much nicer to read that the if file,
            this allows you to check that the translation of your protocol
            fit your expectations.

  -noopt  : Do not try to replace hashing by tokens. (slower dep. on protocol)
            By default, CL-Atse tries to re-organize the protocol to make
            it easier to check. This option disable this functionality.

  -v      : Print more output informations. In particular, in this mode
            CL-Atse write the protocol specification as read form the
            .if file, and write a bit more attack informations.

  -noexec : Do not search for attacks. This disable the search for attacks.
            Consequently, all protocols are seen as "safe" with this option.
            Useful with -ns to look at the protocol specification.

  -bench  : Benchmark output format (very concise).
            This option activate a benchmark mode for CL-Atse. In this mode,
            the output is extremely concise (one line per input if or
            hlpsl file), and stdin an be linked to the stdout of an
            other instance of cl-atse. For example, you can get a nice
            comparison table between typed an untyped models with :
            ~/hlpsl$ cl-atse -bench *.hlpsl | ./cl-atse -bench -notype


  -split  : Use the --split option on hlpsl2if for hlpsl files/
            This option makes cl-atse run once per splited if file.
