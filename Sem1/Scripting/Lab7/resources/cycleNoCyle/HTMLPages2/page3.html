<h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>
<p>Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: স্বামী বিবেকানন্দ) Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɒnɖo] ( listen), Shāmi Bibekānondo; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: নরেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত) (Bengali: [nɔrend̪ro nat̪ʰ d̪ɔt̪t̪o]), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world[4] and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.[5] He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[6] Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.[4] He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, "Sisters and brothers of America ...,"[7] in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.</p>
