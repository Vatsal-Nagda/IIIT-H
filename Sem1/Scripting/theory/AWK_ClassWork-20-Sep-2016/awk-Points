A bit on intro

AWK : used for text processing

Founders : A. Aho, B. W. Kernighan and P. Weinberger. (let's remember them for making text processing simpler for over 4 decades :)  )

We have grep and sed so why awk?

* with grep and sed we cannot search for "specific fields" and replace them with texts, awk comes in handy!
* It brings with it a lot of programming funtionalities.
* We have arrays and other C supported operators.
* A huge programming language by itself! (very very useful for field manipulation)

So, let's start!

Topics for today:

1. simple usage of awk
