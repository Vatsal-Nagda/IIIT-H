A Japanese tourist hailed a taxi in downtown Delhi and asked to be taken to the Indira Gandhi airport. On the way, a car zoomed by and the tourist responded, 'Oh! Toyota - Made in Japan! Very fast!' Not too long afterward, another car flew by the taxi. 'Oh! Nissan - Made in Japan! Very fast!' Then yet another car zipped by, and the tourist said, 'Oh! Mitsubishi Made in Japan! Very fast!'
The taxi driver, who was 100% Indian, was starting to get a little annoyed that the Japanese made cars were passing his taxi, when yet another car passed the taxi as they were turning into the airport. 'Oh! Honda - Made in Japan! Very fast!' 

The taxi driver stopped the car, pointed to the meter, and said, 'That'll be Rupees 500.' 'Rupees 500? It was a short ride! Why so much?' The Taxi driver smiled as he replied, 'Meter - Made in India. Very fast.'
